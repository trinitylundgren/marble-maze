Navigate a handheld marble maze on an LED matrix driven by a Raspberry Pi sampling an accelerometer.

![Prototype Demo](/gif/prototype-demo.gif)

This project is a work in progress. The prototype makes use of the Adafruit_PixelDust submodule's sand physics to test the hardware assembly and provide a proof of concept. The project implements a level-loader that allows the developer to design a level by creating a bitmap in an image editor and passing the bitmap file path to level-loader.

Please see [Hardware Assembly](/docs/hardware-assembly.md) for hardware details.
